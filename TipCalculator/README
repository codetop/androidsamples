Tip Calculator -

Basic tip calclator. 

1. Calculates tips for 15% , 20%, 25%
2. Uses radio buttons. 
3. Auto updates tip amount when check amount is updated (Enter pressed) 

Limitations -

1. Does not validate the text . Will throw errors if you enter invalid amount (does not check for alphabets, negative numbers invalid characters)
2. Ideally the tip amount should be recalculated as the check amount is being typed. It does so on Enter pressed.
