Basic TwitterApp	

This app has the following functionality-

User can sign in using OAuth login flow
User can view last 25 tweets from their home timeline (includes profile image, body, timestamp)
User can compose a new tweet to post
After posting tweet, user should be taken back to timeline with the tweet visible
User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the list (endless scroll)

The application also handles errors from the http client libraries. However not all errors are being passed on to the app by the framework- this needs to be fixed.
